mc500.train.25		mc500.train.25_8	Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad.
mc500.train.25		mc500.train.25_9	He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did.
mc500.train.25		mc500.train.25_10	After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths.
mc500.train.25		mc500.train.25_11	They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.

mc500.train.111		mc500.train.111_6	He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.
mc500.train.111		mc500.train.111_7	Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.
mc500.train.111		mc500.train.111_8	Will walked over to the living room.
mc500.train.111		mc500.train.111_9	On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.
mc500.train.111		mc500.train.111_10	When he was in the living room, it started to rain.

fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_0	A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_1	Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_2	The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_3	Please let me go, it cried, "and one day I will repay you for your kindness."
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_4	The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_5	But the Mouse's chance came, after all.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_6	One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_7	Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free.
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_8	"There!"
fables-06	The Mouse and the Lion	fables-06_9	said the Mouse, "you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_0	A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese.
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_1	Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me!
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_2	Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite.
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_3	If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_4	The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw.
fables-01	The Fox and the Crow	fables-01_5	Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_0	A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns.
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_1	Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_2	Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, "I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure.
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_3	What a fine head!
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_4	What powerful shoulders and thighs!
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_5	But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns?
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_6	You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly.
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_7	Believe me, you would do much better without them."
fables-02	The Lion and the Bull	fables-02_8	The Bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defense, fell an easy prey to the Lion.
fables-04	The Fox and the Stork	fables-04_0	A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup.
fables-04	The Fox and the Stork	fables-04_1	The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth.
fables-04	The Fox and the Stork	fables-04_2	Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement.
fables-04	The Fox and the Stork	fables-04_3	But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease.
fables-04	The Fox and the Stork	fables-04_4	Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.
fables-05	The Farmer and the Fox	fables-05_0	A Farmer was greatly annoyed by a Fox, which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls.
fables-05	The Farmer and the Fox	fables-05_1	So he set a trap for him and caught him; and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go.
fables-05	The Farmer and the Fox	fables-05_2	As ill-luck would have it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting.
fables-05	The Farmer and the Fox	fables-05_3	It quickly caught fire and was all burnt up, and the Farmer lost all his harvest.
fables-03	The Eagle and the Serpent	fables-03_0	An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it.
fables-03	The Eagle and the Serpent	fables-03_1	But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two.
